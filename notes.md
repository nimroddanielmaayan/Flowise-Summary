# Flowise Summary

## General

### The Basics

- KEEP THIS AS AN ARCHIVE, IN CASE I NEED FLOWISE IN THE FUTURE

- Flowise is an open-source platform, with options for either paid cloud hosting
  or self hosting on any server we want

- The Flowise cloud has an option for managing credentials, for several
  editors\users, etc. Also, the licence probably requires using cloud hosting
  for white labeling (I need to check the license)

- The licence should be on GitHub

- The Flowise docs has a list of recommended self-hosting providers

- The course that I'm doing recommends Render for hosting

- For self hosting, we'll probably need to use environment variables

- Self hosting is a good option for clients that want a fully independent "self
  hosted, open source" system, which isn't n8n

- Flowise doesn't have an advanced "front end" for chatbots

- Flowise is a substitute for n8n - for now, I probably won't use it
