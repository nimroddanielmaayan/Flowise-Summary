# Flowise Summary

## General

### The Basics

- Flowise is an open-source platform, with options for either paid cloud hosting
  or self hosting on any server we want

- The Flowise cloud has an option for managing credentials, for several
  editors\users, etc. So it might be a good option for white labeling. Also, the
  licence probably requires using cloud hosting for white labeling (I need to
  check the license)

- The licence should be on GitHub

- The Flowise docs has a list of recommended self-hosting providers

- The course that I'm doing recommends Render for hosting

- For self hosting, we'll probably need to use environment variables

- Self hosting is a good option for clients that want a fully independent "self
  hosted, open source" system
